# city-explorer-api

**Author**: Jason
**Version**: 1.2.1 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This is my first time creating and using a server. The app we are creating takes in a location and presents a map and weather data about the location. The app also presents national park information for nearby parks.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

This app uses: html, css, javascript, mustache, jquery, express, cors, dotenv, and superagent.
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
